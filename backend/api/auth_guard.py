# Demo mode == "an anonymous visitor on the prod (main) branch is browsing
# the algo pages". The chokepoint pattern: every code path that touches a
# real broker, account, or settings goes through one of these helpers.
# A scattered `if not is_admin: ...` in 30 endpoints is a recipe for one
# missing check exposing a real account; a single `is_demo_request()` call
# at the broker / order chokepoints means we either find the bug or we
# don't have one.
#
# Note: dev branches don't have demo mode — anyone who lands on a dev
# deployment without auth is a developer who hasn't logged in yet, not a
# recruiter. The check below explicitly returns False on non-prod so we
# don't accidentally let a dev session into the synthetic data lane.
