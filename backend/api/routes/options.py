"""
`/api/options/*` — options analytics for the /admin/options dashboard.

Computes Greeks, payoff curves, risk metrics (max profit / max loss /
breakeven / POP), theoretical-vs-market discrepancy, and historical
candles for any single-leg option position. Three input modes:

  - `live`         — read qty/avg/LTP from a real broker position
  - `sim`          — read from the SimDriver's `_positions_rows`
  - `hypothetical` — operator-specified symbol + qty; LTP fetched from
                     broker for theoretical analysis before they take
                     the trade.

Underlying spot, current LTP, and historical candles are fetched via
`get_price_broker()` so they honor the `connections.price_account`
setting in /admin/settings — operators centralize "which Kite handle do
we hammer for shared market data" in one place.
