"""
In-process TTL cache for broker API responses.

All heavy Kite API calls (holdings, positions, margins, orders) are cached here.
Cache entries expire after `ttl_seconds`. On expiry the next request re-fetches
and repopulates the cache. The background ARQ worker also calls `invalidate()`
after each successful refresh so the API always serves fresh data immediately
after a background update — without waiting for TTL expiry.

Thread-safe via asyncio.Lock (single-process uvicorn worker).
