"""
Encryption helpers for broker credentials stored in the DB.

Why this exists
  Operators add / edit / delete broker accounts via the /admin/brokers
  page; the api_secret / TOTP seed / login password live in the
  `broker_accounts` table. Storing them in the clear would mean an
  intruder reading a single Postgres row gets full broker control —
  unacceptable. We Fernet-encrypt the three secret columns at rest.

Key derivation
  We do NOT introduce a separate master key in `secrets.yaml`. Instead,
  we derive the Fernet key from the existing `cookie_secret` (already
  required for JWT signing) via HKDF-SHA256 with a fixed info tag. That
  way an operator who already has cookie_secret deployed can also use
  the broker CRUD without provisioning a new secret. Rotating
  cookie_secret invalidates the encrypted columns — the migration path
  is to decrypt-then-re-encrypt before the rotation; we don't auto-do
  that, since cookie_secret rotation is rare and explicit.

Public API
  encrypt(plaintext: str) -> str         (returns base64 ciphertext)
  decrypt(ciphertext: str) -> str
  encrypt_dict(d: dict, fields: list[str]) -> dict
