profile: |
  Highly accomplished FinTech professional with a strong foundation in quantitative finance, 
  evidenced by FRM certification and CFA Level 3 candidacy. Proven expertise in modernizing 
  legacy systems, optimizing high-volume trading platforms, and developing sophisticated 
  algorithmic trading solutions. Deep understanding of cloud/distributed technologies, 
  database & legacy systems, and data analytics. A results-driven professional, recipient of the organization's most 
  coveted Innovation Award, with a proven ability to deliver innovative 
  solutions and drive success within the financial markets.
experience summary:
  - Modernized a high-volume, business-critical legacy application on AWS using Java and Spark. 
    The resulting core framework reduced development and deployment turnaround times by 50 percent.
  - Developed 'Rambo,' an analytics platform that empowered software development teams to reengineer and 
    optimize software artifacts. By providing critical insights into dependencies,
    'Rambo' facilitated the identification and decommissioning of around 3000 batch jobs, significantly improving efficiency.
  - Received the Delivery Excellence Award for designing and developing a Python-based product suite to reengineer 
    legacy COBOL-VSAM applications into COBOL-DB2 applications.
  - As Principal Software Engineer, I'm leading the development of the parsing engine for Cobra, a COBOL research and analysis tool. 
    This engine will track data flow, identify the origin and transformation of critical fields, and ultimately enable accurate data lineage analysis.
  - Developing an algorithmic trading platform that leverages the power of option Greeks and underlying stock prices to identify 
    and exploit fleeting market inefficiencies, enabling automated, data-driven trading decisions.

        General Motors Dealer Information Database (GMDID) Re-engineering Project:
          summary: The General Motors Dealer Information Database (GMDID) is the repository for dealer related data including ship-to locations,
            warranty repair stations, auction sites, etc., and provides for a “total” GM Dealer picture.  GMDID, working in conjunction with the Dealer
            Network Planning System (DNPS) is the “hub of the wheel” interacting and supplying data to all GM downstream systems and non-GM Stakeholders
            that require this data to run the business. There are over 30 GM applications, 1800 users and 134 extract requests provided to non-GM
            Stakeholders each month.  The scope of the project is to create functional spec. and project proposal for the re-engineering project.
