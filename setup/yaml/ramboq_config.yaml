  #### Succession of Active Partners
  > As the saying goes â€” *hope for the best, but always prepare for the worst*.  
  > When it comes to partnersâ€™ hard-earned money, succession planning isnâ€™t optional â€” itâ€™s essential.

  ### âš¡ Energy Storage Potential in India: Pumped Hydro vs. Battery Storage
  
  **18 Aug 2025 Â· Ramana Ambore (Rambo)**
  
  #### Why Energy Storage Matters
  Indiaâ€™s renewable energy mix is increasingly dependent on *solar (daytime)* and *wind (seasonal, nighttime peaks)*.  
  This volatility creates a mismatch between generation and demand. To ensure **Round-the-Clock (RTC)** renewable power, large-scale storage solutions are essential. Both *Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS)* and *Pumped Hydro Storage (PHS)* are emerging as the backbone of Indiaâ€™s energy transition.
  
  #### Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS)
  
  *Characteristics:*  
  - Duration: *1â€“4 hours*  
  - Response: *Milliseconds* (perfect for frequency regulation, balancing, and peak shaving)  
  - Modular and scalable, easy to deploy near load centers  
  - Costs declining rapidly (80% drop since 2015)
  
  *Key Players in India:*  
  - *ReNew Power* â†’ won large-scale BESS tenders integrated with RE.  
  - *JSW Energy* â†’ targeting ~*1 GWh* of BESS.  
  - *Tata Power* â†’ deploying battery-based grid support projects.  
  - *Amp Energy & Greenko* â†’ integrating BESS with hybrid RE projects.
  
  *Use Case:* Firming up *solar/wind parks*, reducing curtailment, improving grid stability, and supporting **green hydrogen electrolysis**.
  
  #### Pumped Hydro Storage (PHS)
  
  *Characteristics:*  
  - Duration: *6â€“10+ hours*  
  - Lifetime: *40â€“60 years* (far longer than batteries)  
  - Lowest cost per kWh for long-duration shifting  
  - Requires favorable geography and long build times (5â€“7 years)
  
  *Key Players in India:*  
  - *Greenko* â†’ developing a massive *50 GWh* PHS pipeline.  
  - *JSW Energy* â†’ planning ~*6 GW* of pumped storage.  
  - *NHPC* â†’ leveraging hydro expertise for new PHS projects.
  
  *Use Case:* Deliver *baseload-like renewable power*, hedge against seasonal solar/wind volatility, and supply nighttime industrial demand.
  
  *Potential for ACME:* Coupling ACMEâ€™s solar/wind projects with PHS enables *true 24Ã—7 renewable energy*â€”critical for export-grade hydrogen and ammonia contracts.
  
  #### Comparative Snapshot
  
  | Feature            | BESS                          | Pumped Hydro (PHS)            |
  |--------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
  | *Duration*         | 1â€“4 hrs                       | 6â€“10+ hrs                     |
  | *Response Time*    | Milliseconds                  | Minutes                       |
  | *CapEx Trend*      | Falling fast                  | Stable, site-specific         |
  | *Lifetime*         | ~10â€“15 yrs                    | 40â€“60 yrs                     |
  | *Scalability*      | Modular, urban-friendly       | Requires geography, water     |
  | *Best Fit*         | Grid balancing, RTC blending  | Long-duration bulk storage    |
  
  #### Outlook for India
  - *BESS* will dominate short-duration applicationsâ€”grid balancing, peak shaving, and distributed renewable projects.  
  - *PHS* will anchor *large-scale, long-duration storage*, especially in states with suitable sites (Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra).  
  - Together, they provide the *firm power backbone* that companies like *ReNew, Greenko, JSW, and Tata Power* require to stabilize renewable portfolios.
  
  #### Conclusion
  As India moves towards its 500 GW renewable energy target by 2030, the synergy between **BESS and PHS** is not a competition, but a complement.  
  
  *ACMEâ€™s leadership in solar and green ammonia* positions it uniquely to benefit from both technologiesâ€”*BESS for short-term flexibility* and *PHS for deep, long-duration firming*.  
  
  This dual approach ensures bankability, reduces curtailment, and supports Indiaâ€™s vision of becoming a **global hub for green hydrogen and ammonia exports**.

  ### Navigating Market Uncertainty: A Long-Term Indian Growth Story  
  **16 Aug 2025 Â· Ramana Ambore (Rambo)**



  #### Global Trade Tensions and Market Outlook  

  Considering the impact of Trumpâ€™s tariffs, I donâ€™t see any major up move in the market for the next one year unless the tariff wars subside. The market is likely to remain volatile, reacting heavily to global news, but without a clear directional breakout.  

  #### Currency Dynamics â€“ Rupeeâ€™s Role  

  On the dollarâ€“rupee conversion rate, I believe the rupee has been depreciated purposefully to offset the impact of tariffs. However, from Prime Minister Modiâ€™s Red Fort speech, it appears that this may not be the long-term path he envisions.  

  #### Indiaâ€™s Strategic Focus â€“ Building Domestic Strength  

  The governmentâ€™s clear priority lies in strengthening manufacturing, defense, electronics, and data centers while boosting domestic consumption. Textile exports are already under pressure. Chemicals and pharma could be next in line, and perhaps even servicesâ€”itâ€™s no longer surprising. That is why I avoided export-oriented sectors from the beginning.  

  #### Trading Strategy â€“ Cushioning Portfolio Risks  

  In this environment, the only practical way to generate returns is by leveraging short-term volatility. I see covered calls as a strong tool to generate consistent profits and cushion potential portfolio losses.  

  #### Policy Shifts â€“ The GST Factor  

  A GST reduction could be a significant positive trigger for domestic manufacturing. Such a move would strengthen competitiveness and attract fresh investments into the Indian economy.  

  #### Indiaâ€™s Long-Term Growth Story  

  Despite near-term headwinds, India remains a strong long-term growth story over the next 10â€“15 years. The structural growth drivers are intact. For the short term, however, I donâ€™t expect major gainsâ€”though the market has proven me wrong many times before. I sincerely hope it proves me wrong again this time.
